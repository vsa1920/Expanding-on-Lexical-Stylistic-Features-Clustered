We are submitting are code in the format of Jupyter Notebooks. The full code base and dataset are hosted through drive links onto these notebooks. So we will need gdown to access them and run these notebooks.

Dependencies needed:

1) gdown
2) Transformers
3) PyTorch
4) Scikit-learn

The Extension-1 comprises of notebooks:

1) Milestone-3 - Extension-1 - final
2) Visualisation_and_Error-analysis

Extension-2 comprises of all the notebooks in the directory Milestone-4 Extension-2

Extension-3 is implemented entirely in the notebook Extension-3_Finetuning-script.
